# Power BI Log Analytics Template Reports

Power BI allows users to configure connections to Azure Log Analytics where they can retain detailed historical activity data.
This repo hosts Power BI Template (.pbit) reports that you can point to your Azure Log Analytics workspaces to load data and get insights right away! 

After opening the template you will be prompted to enter your Log Analytics Workspace ID. Once it has this information and you have logged in to Azure, the report can refresh. 

Here are the available templates:

- **Log Analytics for Analysis Services Engine:** This report allows you to visualize the activity of datasets hosted in the Analysis Services Engine in Power BI workspaces. You can use it to identify load patterns, investigate user actions, look at query performance trends, visualize refreshes, and much more!

## Known Issues
- SE Duration measures are currently blank. This is because Vertipaq Storage Engine events are not yet supported in the Preview.
- If you find the report takes a very long time to refresh and appears to be stuck, try to load a shorter period of time. We have built the Power Query logic with Log analytics Query limits in mind, but it is possible you are hitting limits. Another thing to try is to go to the Regional Settings -> Locale in the template and change it to US date format. We have had reports of European customers having the report load blocked becuase of date conversion errors.

## Datasets Template app goals

The goal of the Template app is to build a tool that can be used to analyze AS Engine behavior in general and to help isolate and debug specific problems in depth. You can slice any operation by using CapacityId, Workspace Name, Dataset Name, and ReportId to give you the necessary context.

The following are some examples of questions that you can answer with the Template app.

### General

* What is the engine activity by capacity and workspace?
* What is the engine load by day or by hour?
* What operations are taking the most CPU time or duration?
* How does the load vary by hour of day?
* Which users are generating load?

### Query

* Which Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) queries were issued in a particular scope?
* Which queries are the most expensive?
* How does a unique DAX query vary over time, and which are the worst?
* What was the query text?
* What were the Storage Engine or DQ queries that were generated from a DAX query?
* How much time did the query spend in Storage Engine versus Formula Engine?
* Did queries use aggregations and what was the performance benefit?

### Refresh

* Which refreshes are expensive?
* Which refreshes overlap?
* Which operations within a refresh are in parallel, and which ones take the longest time?
* What were the different operations and suboperations within a refresh?

### Others

Since the Template app contains various AS Engine events, you can customize it to answer questions related to other events such as Discover or Notification.

## App data source

The Template app loads data from a single Azure Log Analytics workspace.

It doesn't matter if the Log Analytics workspace contains data from many Power BI workspaces. It also doesn't matter which level of administrator configured logging. The log schemas are exactly the same for every role, so there's only one version of the Template app. There are different levels of aggregation to accommodate a range of use cases. For more information, see [Using Log Analytics in Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/log-analytics/desktop-log-analytics-overview)

## App data model

The Template app has the following tables and relationships:

* User
* Query Duration Segment
* Scenario
* Calendar
* Time
* Operation
* Suboperation - Aggregations
* Suboperation - Query
* Suboperation - Refresh

The following image is an entity relationship (ER) diagram.

## App parameters

The following parameters are defined in the template:

|**Parameter**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
|Days Ago To Start |Load data from the specified day to the time the call was initiated. The maximum value you can select is 30 days. However, your Premium capacity memory limits apply to this parameter. If those limits are exceeded, the Template app might fail to refresh.|
|Days Ago To Finish |Load data up to the specified number of days ago. Use 0 for today. |
|Log Analytics Table |Preset values corresponding to the Log Analytics source table:<br> - PowerBIDatasetsWorkspace<br> - PowerBIDatasetsTenant <br> Currently only PowerBIDatasetsWorkspace is supported. |
|Log Analytics WorkspaceId |Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the Azure Log Analytics workspace containing the AS Engine data. |
UTC Offset |An hourly offset used to convert the data from Coordinate Universal Time (UTC) to a local time zone. |
Pagination Hours | This parameter is optional. It describes the time window for each log analytics call from Power BI. You only need to update this parameter if you're running into failures while fetching data due to data size exceeding Log Analytics limits. |

## Considerations and limitations

* Log Analytics Query Limits

  * Kusto has limits in terms of the number of records returned and the overall size of the data based on the query. The Template app has been built to work around these limits by pulling data in sequential chunks. However, you might still exceed these limits, resulting in a refresh failure in the Template app. For more information, see [Query Limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/concepts/querylimits).

  * If the Template app refresh fails due to the previously mentioned data limits, you can configure the Pagination Hours parameter. Setting a lower value here lowers the amount of data retrieved from Log Analytics per call by increasing the number of calls.

* The following events are intentionally excluded from Log Analytics during the Preview:
  
  * ProgressReportCurrent
  * ProgressReportBegin
  * ProgressReportError
  * VertipaqSEQueryBegin
  * VertipaqSEQueryEnd

  Due to this design decision, storage engine subqueries aren't visible for now on the Query detail page.
